# Pig-Game (A JavaScript game)

## The rules:
The game has 2 players, each taking their turn.
Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result is added to their round score.
But, if the player rolls the dice and rolls a 1, his round score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The player can choose 'Hold', which means that his round score is added to the global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.
The players can restart the game by clicking on the 'New game' button.
